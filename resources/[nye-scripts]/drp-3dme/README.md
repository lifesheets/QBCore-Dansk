<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>Heyo folks,<br />
another leaked shit of mine that had I had to post unless these leakers will receive all the credit about script I made from scratch,<br />
<br />
anyways since I'm hosting an RP server for israeli community which their main language is hebrew that doesn't being support by GTA fonts, I had to make that with HTML so it'll support all languages such as : Hebrew, arabic, and I don't really know what else, you can customize that to your like, i'll not provide any updates or support, just drag & drop, it won't cause any problems.<br /></p>

<h3>Usage:</h4>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline">/me - will put a text on your character for x seconds.</code></li>
<li><code class="inline">/do will put a text above your character for x seconds.</code></li>
<li><code class="inline">Display time, color and font can be change to your like, </code></li>
</ul>
